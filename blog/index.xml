      <description>Hey guys. This is my second update.
I really wanted to do a weekly update, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do it last week. It seemed to me that there was nothing worth showing to everyone. A friend said to me, &amp;ldquo;You should update your development blog every week. And see if it&amp;rsquo;s better to look good or to be forgotten by everyone.
Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s worth it to write that development isn&amp;rsquo;t going well.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone,
Thank you for your interest in my work and for coming here.
On March 2, 2021, I posted a pixel art on twitter.
WIP #gamedev #Indiegamedev pic.twitter.com/BcddyRq7Xr
&amp;mdash; SLOTET (@slotet_pixel) March 2, 2021  This is the concept art for my game, which I drew little by little in between contract jobs. As many of you may know, this pixel art was seen by quite a few people. This is the first time in my life that I&amp;rsquo;ve done this, so I was very surprised, and more than anything, I was happy to see the warm response from you guys.</description>
