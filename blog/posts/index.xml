      <description>Hey guys, I&amp;rsquo;m still alive.
These are just a few prototype videos.

      <description>Good evening. I&amp;rsquo;m a day late with the update.
To be honest, there is nothing much to post. I&amp;rsquo;m starting to feel that it would be reckless to update every week, so I think I&amp;rsquo;ll go back to updating irregularly from now on.
I was down with a cold, but I&amp;rsquo;m better now and my motivation has picked up a lot in the past two days. I will be back to developing again in good spirits.</description>

      <description>Hey guys. No images or videos this week.
My original plan was to upload a few progress images each week at&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;. Is this due to my laziness or just lack of talent? That&amp;rsquo;s the mood I&amp;rsquo;m in.
I had a dinner with my wife&amp;rsquo;s family the other day, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t smile at all, I was downcast the whole time. It was my own inadequacy. Simply put, I&amp;rsquo;m not doing very well.</description>

      <title>SSS#8.5 - Why I quit pixel art</title>

      <description>(This article is not about game dev. It is an edited version of a personal letter.)
TO: ****
I am still a little concerned about my refusal to accept your invitation. I feel like I was being a little mean when I made the statement that &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t trust your boss.&amp;rdquo; The truth is that I have completely lost all desire to create a background in pixel art.
I spent my late teens and early twenties studying to become an animation background artist.</description>

      <description>Hey guys. No videos or pics this week. I put a sprite of the character on the background of the sneak peek I wrote last week and moved it around. I was very happy with the result, but I can&amp;rsquo;t publish it on the internet because of copyright issues with the sprite I used as a placeholder. In any case, I can report that I have made some progress in the initial stages of graphic development.</description>

      <description>I have decided to update this devlog every Monday from now on. As you know, my progress is very slow, so I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to write much, but I thought it&amp;rsquo;s important to update even the most trivial things.
There is something I forgot to upload in my last post. A video of a camera test with defold-orthographic. I am considering using it in the future because it is easy to control the zoom from the script, although some adjustments are necessary.</description>

      <description>Hey everyone. I&amp;rsquo;d like to report on the progress I&amp;rsquo;ve made over the past week or so. I am still sketching over and over.
At first I had in mind the story of a man living in a city. Something like this(or please read previous post).
 However, I gradually realized that as a painter I did not enjoy painting cities.
   (lol, example of trying to emphasize a distinctive style and losing myself.</description>

      <description>Hey guys. I finally published a small game the past few days.
The Hollo Men on itch.io
As those of you who have played it will know (if you haven&amp;rsquo;t, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to play it, it&amp;rsquo;s a waste of time), this is an undeniably shitty game. I spent about a month on it, and I produced crap.
But I don&amp;rsquo;t regret it too much, because the requirements I set when I started this project had been met.</description>

      <title>SSS#3 - Ludum Dare 48: My first challenge to a game jam.</title>

      <description>On April 24 - 27, 2021, Ludum Dare 48 - An event to create a game in 72 hours - was held.
I was invited by my friend Thomas Olsson to participate in my first game jam as an pixel artist. I would like to share my overall impressions.
I think it would be helpful for artists who are interested in game jam but have never participated in it before.</description>

      <title>SSS #2 - Considering about genre, and some sketches</title>

      <description>Hey guys. This is my second update.
I really wanted to do a weekly update, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do it last week. It seemed to me that there was nothing worth showing to everyone. A friend said to me, &amp;ldquo;You should update your development blog every week. And see if it&amp;rsquo;s better to look good or to be forgotten by everyone.
Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s worth it to write that development isn&amp;rsquo;t going well.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone,
Thank you for your interest in my work and for coming here.
On March 2, 2021, I posted a pixel art on twitter.
WIP #gamedev #Indiegamedev pic.twitter.com/BcddyRq7Xr
&amp;mdash; SLOTET (@SlotetStudios) March 2, 2021  This is the concept art for my game, which I drew little by little in between contract jobs. As many of you may know, this pixel art was seen by quite a few people. This is the first time in my life that I&amp;rsquo;ve done this, so I was very surprised, and more than anything, I was happy to see the warm response from you guys.</description>
