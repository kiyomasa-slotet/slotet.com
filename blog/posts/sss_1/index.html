&mdash; SLOTET (@slotet_pixel) March 2, 2021  This is the concept art for my game, which I drew little by little in between contract jobs. As many of you may know, this pixel art was seen by quite a few people. This is the first time in my life that I&rsquo;ve done this, so I was very surprised, and more than anything, I was happy to see the warm response from you guys.'>

<p>This is the concept art for my game, which I drew little by little in between contract jobs. As many of you may know, this pixel art was seen by quite a few people. This is the first time in my life that I&rsquo;ve done this, so I was very surprised, and more than anything, I was happy to see the warm response from you guys. I&rsquo;ve been posting pixel art and small games on the Internet for a while now, but I&rsquo;ve never gotten this many responses before. So I&rsquo;m going to open this devblog to share my development progress, sketches, and other stuff. I titled the blog SSS, which means &ldquo;Slotet Solo Sailing&rdquo; or &ldquo;Saturady Small Scheme&rdquo; or whatever. It&rsquo;s a twist on <a href="https://factorio.com/blog/">Friday Factorio Facts</a>, of course! I&rsquo;m doing this website and game development completely solo, so it&rsquo;s hard for me to write a weekly report, but I&rsquo;ll try to do as much as I can.</p>
<p>Well then, let&rsquo;s write about the game. As of last week, I actually had only one piece of concept art, a few sketches, and a lot of imagination. Anyway, I decided to put it into the game engine and try to run it, so I drew some character animations and added some post-processing. The results are as follows.</p>

  <p>Your browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can <a href="/blog/posts/sss_1/20210313_1.mp4">download it</a> and watch it with your favorite video player!</p>
</video>
<p>&hellip; Yeah, that&rsquo;s it. After all, we&rsquo;re still in the super early stage. Sometimes people ask me, &ldquo;What kind of game is this going to be?&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t answer that question at all, because I don&rsquo;t really know what I&rsquo;m making. I&rsquo;m going to think about it little by little as I draw and code, so please take your time and watch over it!</p>
