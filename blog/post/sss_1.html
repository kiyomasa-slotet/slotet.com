          Hello everyone,<br/>
          Thank you for your interest in my work and for coming here.

          On March 2, 2021, I posted a pixel art on twitter.

          This is the concept art for my game, which I drew little by little in between contract jobs. As many of you may know, this pixel art was seen by quite a few people. This is the first time in my life that I've done this, so I was very surprised, and more than anything, I was happy to see the warm response from you guys. I've been posting pixel art and small games on the Internet for a while now, but I've never gotten this many responses before.

          Well then, let's write about the game. As of last week, I actually had only one piece of concept art, a few sketches, and a lot of imagination. Anyway, I decided to put it into the game engine and try to run it, so I drew some character animations and added some post-processing. The results are as follows.

          ... Yeah, that's it. After all, we're still in the super early stage. Sometimes people ask me, "What kind of game is this going to be?" I can't answer that question at all, because I don't really know what I'm making. I'm going to think about it little by little as I draw and code, so please take your time and watch over it!
