      <description>On April 24 - 27, 2021, Ludum Dare 48 - An event to create a game in 72 hours - was held.
I was invited by my friend Thomas Olsson to participate in my first game jam as an pixel artist. I would like to share my overall impressions.
I think it would be helpful for artists who are interested in game jam but have never participated in it before.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone,
Thank you for your interest in my work and for coming here.
On March 2, 2021, I posted a pixel art on twitter.

&amp;mdash; SLOTET (@slotet_pixel) March 2, 2021  This is the concept art for my game, which I drew little by little in between contract jobs. As many of you may know, this pixel art was seen by quite a few people. This is the first time in my life that I&amp;rsquo;ve done this, so I was very surprised, and more than anything, I was happy to see the warm response from you guys.</description>
